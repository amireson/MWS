# 5. Summary of Findings

In the data analysis section, when the seasonal load at Big Eddy Camp (downstream of the E.B. Campbell Dam) for two different years, i.e., 2014 and 2017 were compared, one similarity was that the load peaked in June for both the years. This finding could be helpful to study the relationship between the outflow of the dam and the load changes in the downstream.

The second finding of this project was related to the analysis of sediment loss between upstream and downstream of the E.B. Campbell Dam in 2014. With the sediment loss of over one million ton, it is evident that the dam has a significant negative effect on the downstream morphology. Therefore, urgent counter-measures are required to regain the sediment concentration in the dam downstream. These measures are discussed at length in Section 6.

Another observation was obtained when spot measurement readings of Big Eddy Camp were compared to the monitored readings for the same site and dates. The spot measurement or estimated readings were found to be greater than the recorded readings. The error in the estimated readings was not constant as the dates of the reading changes and therefore these estimations cannot be relied upon for future calculation.

The last finding of this project was unchanged sediment load in the downstream of the E.B. Campbell Dam over the past 30 years. With the difference of only 16,000 tons when the seasonal load of the year 1988 was compared to that of the year 2014, it is quite thought-provoking that, although the dam has been present for multi-decade, the seasonal load in the downstream of the dam has not much changed.
