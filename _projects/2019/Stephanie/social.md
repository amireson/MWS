# Social Engagment Activity

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case study of the City of Melfort provide an in depth look at the water management decisions that occurred during the 2016 Husky oil spill, and which factors led to the community’s success while dealing with a contaminated drinking water supply. Sound practices from this case study can be shared by policy makers, and amongst communities who have common vulnerabilities for the use of source water. The timeframe for this project was May to August, 2019. In order to achieve the goal of this study, the qualitative research began with a literature review. The literature review included both grey and academic literature, which helped provide both evidence-informed practices and local contextualized information to understand the incident. The review of grey documents included several sources of the incident through news releases, annual reports, advisories, service bulletins, and archived records. There was less academic literature of peer reviewed articles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case study was granted ethics approval by the University of Saskatchewan and University of Regina, with the Johnson Shoyama Graduate Scholl of Public Policy. The literature review was followed by qualitative methods to acquire more local knowledge by directly contacting and interviewing key people. From initial contacts provided by the industry partner, additional contacts were sourced for phone calls, emails, and interviews using the snowball method. Using a variety of qualitative collection tools proved useful for participants to share information regarding the incident; in addition, the different methods provide a broader perspective of the incident, and may offer more validity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone calls and emails were relied on throughout the whole research process to gather gaps in information. In-person interviews were conducted in the City of Melfort between June and July, 2019. Prior to interviews taking place, the potential candidates were notified by phone and asked if they would participate in the case study interview. An approved consent process was followed. Since the case study focused on the City of Melfort, interviewees were selected based on their social standing within the community, their authority in relation to water management decisions, and their technical knowledge of water treatment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semi-structured interviews was the preferred research method because they allowed for a natural dialogue to develop around the researcher’s questions; consequently, interviewees are able to a share thoughts and perspectives they felt were important in addition to the common themes asked by the interviewer. Interview guides were prepared for each interview. The guides were tailored to each participant, but shared common themes of impacts on the community, factors in success, barriers in success, and proposed solutions for the future. Prior to recording the interviews participants were made aware of the case study’s purpose, risks, and terms of confidentiality. Informed consent was received via the consent form. Interviews were recorded on a digital recorder, transcribed into a word document, and then analyzed. Each of the responses were compared and contrasted in order to determine themes. For full transcript interviews please see attached appendices.
