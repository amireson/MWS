# Introduction

## Literature review
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water resource management, especially the management of potable water sources, has become more critical with the increasing pressure of climate change, severity of natural disasters, anthropogenic contamination events, and an increased demand by a growing population. Making decisions with water resource management can be more difficult with an increasing amount of uncertainty (Clark, 2002).

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether water management has a top-down approach, or a holistic bottom-up approach, there are a multitude of ways that water resources can be managed. Exploring community based solutions, and adaptive management strategies, has become more prominent in recent decades as the top-down approach has demonstrated some inefficiencies socially, economically, and environmentally (Weston & Conrad, 2015). With increased participation from local experts, local knowledge can be integrated into decision making to create more sustainable management of our water resources (Weston & Conrad, 2015). The following brief literature review will highlight some of the recent studies that explored numerous ways communities, around the world, are dealing with increasing uncertainty with their drinking water resources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weston and Conrad (2015) found that citizen based science has become a best practice in water management when it used complimentary to regulating decision makers. The 2015 study focused on community-based water monitoring, or management, (CBWM) programs in Nova Scotia, but acknowledges that effective CBWM programs have been successful in other parts of Canada, the Netherlands, United States, Australia, United Kingdom, and Southeast Asia (Weston & Conrad, 2015). Credit to successful CBWM has been attributed to financial resources, technical standards, integrated water resource management, volunteer reciprocity, and knowledge and resource-sharing (Weston & Conrad, 2015). This means, the study found that there needs to be sufficient funds to support long-term water initiatives with technical systematic data collection. In addition, an integrated perspective to water management includes considering land use and human impacts on the watershed (Weston & Conrad, 2015). Resource-sharing is meant to have the volunteer collected data accessible to all the stakeholders and optimize the information (Weston & Conrad, 2015). In summary you need the sufficient financial, technical, and human resources to optimize the capacities of the community-based water management networks that can be used in concert with regulating bodies for more sustainable resource management (Weston & Conrad, 2015).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another study, conducted in Switzerland by Domingues et al. (2011), explored 3 strategies that water managers have discussed using to deal with increasing uncertainty around water infrastructure. The future use of urban water infrastructure was assessed under an adaptive management perspective, scenario modelling perspective, and a managerial perspective; however, each of these views had limitations to their application. The adaptive perspective focuses on incremental change to infrastructure to overcome uncertainty; however, this method is most effective when the level of uncertainty remains low. The scenario modelling perspective allows management to prioritize and prepare for the most likely unforeseen circumstance, but this management may create a false sense of security (Domingues et al., 2011). By prioritizing the most probable events, it often excludes preparation measures for other unexpected factors which also create uncertainty and risk to infrastructure (Domingues et al., 2011). The managerial perspective looks at technical or personnel flexibility within the infrastructure system to overcome uncertainty (Domingues et al., 2011).  The study determined that the adaptive management, scenario modelling, and managerial perspectives are beneficial for combating some uncertainty because they have are often detailed with clear plan with a cost to benefit ratio; however, the addition a discursive perspective could be complement these perspectives when considering the future use of the water infrastructure sector (Domingues et al., 2011).  The discursive perspective uses a systematic qualitative approach that uses discussions from varying stakeholder viewpoints in consideration of objectives, options, and future plans to accompany the previous perspective with a wider view (Domingues et al., 2011).  Including the discursive perspective integrates participatory knowledge into strategies and assessment criteria to be considered; in addition, it strengthens perspectives with a more comprehensive view into how uncertainty is framed (Stirling, 2008).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncertainty around infrastructure also relates to the uncertainty of long-term provisions of water supplies.  Many communities are implementing drought plans, as a way of mitigating future uncertainty of water provisions. Engle (2012) explored drought in the United States with varying temporal and spatial scales.  The researcher examined the adaptive capacity in Georgia and Arizona across varying temporal or spatial scale. Smit et al. (2011) defined adaptive capacity as the, “ability of a system to prepare for stress and changes in advance or adjust and respond to the effects caused by the stress”. Engle (2012) identified that most states react to drought, rather than prepare for a drought; however, it is common in many regions of the world to have reactive emergency measures rather than proactive measures in place. The researcher explored how drought preparedness impacted communities’ resilience by varying temporal and spatial scales.  Engle (2012) found some common themes that existed between states for effective building of adaptive capacity when dealing with drought. Drought plans prepared at the local level are often the most effective (Engle, 2012).  Drought plans should have some flexibility in their planning, and take climate change into account. It is important for drought plans to be comprehensive and have cooperation between local systems to help maintain support with the plan implementation (Engle, 2012). Therefore, it is becoming more prominent that community-based solutions are an effective way to integrate local knowledge into sustainable water management.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newson and Chalk (2004) conducted a similar study analyzing the community-led best management practices involving 2 river basins in northern England. While the 2 river basins differed in size, there was a number of commonalities the researchers found for a successful environmental project management. The adaptive management of the river basins included participation from surrounding communities with the sentiment of “thinking globally and acting locally” (Newson & Chalk, 2004). Including the participation of local residents, with the involvement of major stakeholders, allowed for additional dialogue to develop around the sustainable management of the different river basins (Newson & Chalk, 2004). One of the important findings was that there needed to be organized information management from the beginning of the project; furthermore, project coordinators are vital in mediating strategies, operations, and funding to keep the project going (Newson & Chalk, 2004).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some researchers have focused on the reactive response to water management after a natural disaster.  Patterson and Adams (2011) have investigated ways to keep the public safe after there has been a contamination of their water supply. Human health is obviously the first priority with water services, but sometimes in a major disruption residents may be left vulnerable to a contamination drinking water supply; therefore, some organizations are investing in technologies which can act as small temporary water treatment units, and help reduce the vulnerability of citizens.  These technologies may be based in the home, or they may be mobile units that can treat water tanks, wells, and water distribution systems (Patterson & Adams, 2011). Patterson and Adams (2011) advice for having emergency plans in place with a prioritization of disasters, but sometime the magnitude of a disaster can be so disruptive that people cannot properly respond. Point-of-use (POU) devices are low cost, and can be easily installed in homes, apartments or offices (Patterson & Adams, 2011). Pour-through devices are similar to POU devices with treating a smaller volumes of water (Patterson & Adams, 2011). Mobile treatment systems have also been developed to use at hospitals and first responder locations during a major emergency (Patterson & Adams, 2011).

 ## Introduction to the Melfort Case Study
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case study, reported here was part of a larger project, with the Saskatchewan Association of Watersheds (SAW), which looked at the implementation of community based solutions, through best management practices and adaptive management, to help communities become more resilient. The purpose of this study was to identify the key factors which led to Melfort’s adaptive water management during the 2016 Husky Energy oil spill that contaminated the City’s source water, the North Saskatchewan River. Many communities rely on the North Saskatchewan River, and other surface water bodies vulnerable to contamination, as a source of drinking water; therefore, similar communities may be able to become more resilient by applying the lessons and practices used by Melfort. Alternate source plans, critical knowledge, and effective use of resources were some of the contributing factors to Melfort’s success.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some key concepts that the paper focused on was knowledge, vulnerability, resiliency, and adaptive management in relation to water resource management. There are many different kinds of knowledge that exist in society; however, for the scope of the paper, knowledge referred to having important information, experience, and relationships that are practical to completing a task (Al-Alawi, 2007). The concept of vulnerability focused on communities’ drinking water, and the possible source water liabilities that may expose residents to potential hazards. Adaptive Management refers to incremental change over time in water resource management to overcome vulnerability related to uncertainty. Resiliency referred to identify vulnerabilities, in order to improve a community’s capacities and mitigate risk related to uncertainty.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case study began with a literature review of academic and grey literature, followed by multiple qualitative data collection methods. Using multiple methods, individuals were questioned using semi-structured in-person interviews, phone calls, and emails for collecting additional information regarding the 2016 Husky oil spill. Five individuals were interviewed in-person, over the 4 month period of the project. Prior to participating in the interviews participants were made aware of the case study’s purpose, risks, and confidentiality. Instrumentation consisted of a digital audio recorder and the interview was then transcribed into a word document before being analyzed.
The introduction to the report is followed by the basic overview of the situation in the City of Melfort during the time of the contaminated water source. Included in the overview is a chronological timeline which shows the events, and decisions made during the Husky Energy pipeline rupture. The timeline is followed by an outline of the research process which demonstrated how the information was collected, and analyzed during the project; consequently, the findings section was developed from common themes produced during the research process. The report finishes with a discussion of the case study’s purpose, and then the recommendations and conclusions about strategies that would benefit communities if commonly employed moving forward.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melfort’s water treatment plant was built in 1958 (SaskWater, 2019). While there were additional upgrades in 1972, the water treatment plant was never equipped to treat for hydrocarbons. From 1958 to 1993, Melfort’s primary water source was the Melfort Creek, with the Star City Reservoir also being drawn by the City up until 1993. Melfort has always had an alternative water supply.

The above figure is a picture of the SaskWater water treatment plant in Melfort.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Star City Reservoir was created by the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA), which was established in 1935 by the Federal government as a branch of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (Gilson, 2013). The PFRA was developed during a period of drought as a way of helping promote stewardship and sustainable development in the Prairie Provinces in terms of water use, land use, soil preservation, and agricultural practices (Gilson, 2013). Although the PFRA was disbanded in 2010, during its operations the organization established a number of water focused projects including pipelines, irrigation district agreements, dugouts, wells, dams, and reservoirs (Diaz, Hulbert, & Warren, 2016).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, Melfort sold their water treatment plant to SaskWater which is the province’s commercial Crown water utility (SaskWater, 2017). Following the purchase of the water plant, SaskWater created the Codette Lake Water Supply System (CLWSS) which was a regional water supply network that provided water to numerous communities out of the North Saskatchewan River (SaskWater, 2017). In order to ensure the regional water supply could be constructed, the water treatment plant underwent upgrades which included disconnecting the pipeline from Melfort Creek into the water treatment plant, but keeping the PFRA Star City reservoir pipeline as part of the plant’s infrastructure. With the successful transformation of the water treatment plant, SaskWater’s was able to provide potable water services to roughly 9000 people; including individuals from Melfort, Star City, Weldon, Kinistino, Beatty, and 2 rural pipelines. Regional systems have been described as most cost-effective and sustainable way to meet the water needs of multiple consumers (SaskWater, 2019). SaskWater uses their Codette Lake Pump Station to provide water for the Melfort area pipeline network which has an intake that is nearly 17’ below the North Saskatchewan River’s surface.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SaskWater and Melfort has had a successful partnership for a number of years, and the City of Melfort renewed their contract with SaskWater in 2019. SaskWater currently uses the City of Melfort’s reservoirs as the commercial supplier’s storage reservoirs, so maintaining a good relationship has remained a priority. As of 2019, SaskWater has leased additional land from the City of Melfort to help the water treatment plant undergo upgrades. The $8.5 million upgrades will include backup power sources, and water treatment upgrades (SaskWater, 2019).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 21, 2016 when the Husky Energy pipeline ruptured and spilled heavy crude into the North Saskatchewan River, it concerned people in water management from the City and SaskWater. Unofficial meetings began on July 24, between Melfort and SaskWater to begin proactive measures and find an alternative water supply. The following official meeting, on July 25, included stakeholders from the City of Melfort, SaskWater, Water Security Agency, the health region, and Husky Energy to discuss pertinent issues. The contamination event lasted for nearly 2 months, 57 days; a primary concern for Melfort and its residents. During that time the City of Melfort and SaskWater relied on the Star City Reservoir as their alternative water source water. Initially there were concerns about the difficulty in treating the water from the reservoir due to a high amount of organic matter. Trihalomethanes (THMs) are produce when water high in organic material is treated with a chlorine disinfectant, and are a dangerous carcinogen which have been linked to cancer (Health Canada, 2009). As a cautionary measure a PDWA was issued to communities of the CLWSS pipeline; fortunately, SaskWater was successful in treating the water with vast amounts of potassium permanganate and the PDWA was soon rescinded (Mansuy, 2016). Potassium permanganate is an oxidant pre-treatment used to reduce the concentration of organics in water supplies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Husky Energy took full responsibility for the incident and remunerated the community’s total costs. Reuptake for the CLWSS began on September 16, 2016 at the North Saskatchewan River, and concluded Melfort’s water contamination concerns.

Description of background to the problem, including a literature review. May include a short profile of the partner organization and their specific problem. End the introduction with a set of project objectives.

## Objective

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was created to determine which community based solutions generated Melfort’s successful response to the 2016 oil spill; subsequently, the lessons learned from these practices may benefit similar communities to become more resilient in the face of uncertainty.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this objective experts in Melfort water management were contacted for interviews. Interviewees commented on decisions made during the time of the water contamination, what they would keep the same about their response, what they would change about their response, and their suggestions for other communities.
