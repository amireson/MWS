# Executive Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking water is vital for life. Canada is fortunate enough to have nearly 20% of the world’s freshwater supply (Environment Canada, 2019). Many communities across Canada rely on surface water as their primary source of potable water; however, surface water is often vulnerable to contamination. Nearly 57% of Saskatchewan residents rely on surface water, so the quantity and quality of surface water is important to consider (Government of Saskatchewan, 2015). Water is essential for the daily functioning of healthy communities; consequently, it may be devastating for a community to suffer an unexpected contamination event to their potable water source. Some communities in Saskatchewan have experienced events that have placed their residents in a vulnerable position. Severe localized damage due to natural emergencies like floods, droughts, wildfires, tornadoes, convective storms, blizzards, and other severe weather events can leave communities devastated; however, the impact of human-related emergencies can be even more distressing to people, property, and the environment. The consideration of what makes communists resilient to unexpected challenges could benefit citizens, policy makers, researchers, government administrations, and community organizations. This project examines what factors contributed to Melfort’s successful response to an unexpected drinking water emergency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 21, 2016, a Husky Energy pipeline ruptured due to riverbank destabilization near Maidstone, Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Cities’ Water, 2016). The pipeline rupture released nearly 225 000 liters of crude oil into the North Saskatchewan River (Saskatchewan River Water, 2016). One single litre of oil is capable of contaminating up to 2 million litres of water so the destructive impact from the oil spill was widespread (Government of Saskatchewan, 2015). Communities that relied on the North Saskatchewan River as their source water, including the City of Melfort, had to close their water intake systems, and find an alternative water source; however, unlike many neighbouring communities Melfort was able to navigate this challenges with little disruption in water services (Lang, 2019). This project explored the factors which contributed to the adaptation of the community to the oil spill. The research method included a literature review, and a multiple-methods approach that focused on uncovering the community-based solutions used by Melfort. The multiple-methods approach used a process of expert elicitation, interviews with key individuals in Melfort’s water management, and modified Delphi interactions to gather additional information on the community’s reaction and analyze findings (Bolger & Wright, 2017).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study revealed several factors that contributed to Melfort’s resilience. The first was early recognition of the problem; that is, the City of Melfort’s primary water source was contaminated by the release of oil into the North Saskatchewan River. Therefore, from the outset, the City of Melfort and SaskWater worked closely together during contamination event. The second factor was that the City and SaskWater promoted proactive approaches by engaging individuals in water management to prepare alternative sources. In addition, Melfort was fortunate to have knowledgeable individuals who used their critical knowledge, specialized experience, and resourceful relationships to champion their way through the City’s water challenges. The City of Melfort did not declare a state of emergency during the Husky oil spill; however, the community used portions of the emergency management plans to provide guidance. These plans are mandatory under the Emergency Planning Act, 1989, and provide more value for communities besides emergency situations; in addition, they foster a culture of preparedness. It was useful and efficient to have an Emergency Operations Center (EOC), emergency directories, and maps readily available for dealing with the crisis. Directories can also be vital for communication. There was a multitude of ways for Melfort to contact its citizens with notices. The citizens were informed through the use of electronic billboards, radio notifications, door knockers, social media, and old-fashioned word of mouth. The transparency of the managers, and effective communication systems helped citizens stay up to date with the Precautionary Drinking Water Advisory (PDWA). They were quickly informed of additional free water being trucked into the community. Additionally, managers understood the importance of perception within a community. People’s perception of their water quality may influence people’s health and wellbeing, so treated water had to be more than safe for human consumption (Dupont et al., 2014). When treated potable water appears discolored or has a mild odour some citizens may perceive that water to be unsafe. It was thought that perceived poor water quality could influence the moral of the community, and Melfort wanted to foster trust with their citizens and maintain the positive relationships. Relationships with neighbouring communities can also be an innovative resource to have during an emergency. A final factor that helped Melfort succeed was the climate. The stable climate ensured that the reservoir was full of water, whereas, if there were years of prolonged drought the water quantity and quality would have degraded beyond of the point of treatment. By following Melfort’s example, we can help communities that rely on the Saskatchewan River, and surface water, to become less vulnerable and more resilient to unforeseen challenges.
