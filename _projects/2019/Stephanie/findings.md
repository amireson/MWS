# Summary of findings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was created to determine which community based solutions generated Melfort’s successful response to the 2016 oil spill; subsequently, the lessons learned from these practices may benefit similar communities to become more resilient in the face of uncertainty.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factors which most contributed to Melfort’s response were thematically generated from interview participants’ responses.  The research method with the modified Delphi was beneficial for taking the collective knowledge of expert individuals to create a comprehensive consideration to the City’s success (Bolger & Wright, 2017).  From the identified factors, these could be translated into practical actions for other communities to replicate to reduce their vulnerability to contamination of their drinking water.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, many communities across the province will inevitably experience more uncertainty and variability with increasing pressure from climate change. Saskatchewan has an extensive history of natural disasters which have left cities and towns devastated, but this does not eliminate the importance of human-related emergencies which have also left their imprint on the province, such as the Husky Energy pipeline rupture. This research may be important for rural Saskatchewan where smaller communities may be more remote with limited financial, technical, or human resources. Limited resources can result in greater vulnerability to disasters with a greater damage to humans, property, and the environment; however, with the proper proactive strategies in place it can maximize the resource the community does have (Government of Saskatchewan, 2003). Disaster preparedness will help reduce communities’ vulnerability, and produce more resilient communities in the face of climate change and the unknown.
