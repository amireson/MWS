# Towards a solution

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solutions begin by reviewing the stakeholders impacted by the water contamination event due to the Husky pipeline rupture; followed by, the identification of the thematically assembled factors which contributed to Melfort’s success. The themes included the key community communication tools used, key people involved, the key knowledge used, infrastructural advantages, and existing plans. Finally the findings conclude with additional unexpected findings that the interviewees felt were important to share.

## Who was involved in the water management decisions?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first informal meeting was organized by the EMO coordinator, and held in Melfort City Hall on Sunday, July 24th. This initial meeting included a small group of people with the EMO Coordinator (Director of Works and Utilities), Manager of the SaskWater Water Treatment Plant, City Manager, and City Clerk to discuss what proactive measures could be taken to deal with a contaminated water source. When the individuals were notified that the spill would impact the water supply, it was decided to start flushing the old pipeline from their alternative water supply, the Star City Reservoir. Melfort was fortunate to have an alternative water supply, the Star City Reservoir, which was sufficient to supply the customers of the CLWSS.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first formal meeting occurred on Monday, June 25th, and included the EMO, Water Security Agency’s Environment Protection Officer (EPO), SaskWater, Kelsey Trail Health Authority, City Manager, elected officials and a Husky representative. The formal meeting was arranged to discuss concerns, and assess the actions of water management to mitigate the impacts of the oil spill; in addition, Melfort was updated by officials that the entire water column had become contaminated, and confirmed an alternate water source would be necessary.

## Keys to Melfort’s Success & Future Recommendations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following section reviews the specific key factors which contributed to Melfort’s success. These themes were developed as the most significant contributing factors to Melfort’s success based on responses from the interviewees; in addition, these key factors would be most feasible options other communities to replicate to reduce their vulnerability.

### Framing the Problem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of 225 000 litres of crude oil into the North Saskatchewan River was an obvious problem for the City of Melfort and SaskWater staff (Government of Saskatchewan, 2016). After being formally notified that the contamination of the North Saskatchewan would impact the CLWSS, individuals in water management knew an alternative water source would be needed. Both the City of Melfort and SaskWater interviewees felt they had the support that they needed during the disruption, and said that Husky took full responsibility for the water contamination (Lang, 2019). Melfort was directly contacted by a representative from Husky Energy that any of the cost procured during the disruption would be fully compensated by Husky. Often when stakeholders cannot agree on plan implementation it is due to budgetary reasons; however, this was not the case for Melfort (Wang, 2013).

### Use of Knowledge in Decision Making
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is a valuable asset which can easily be overlooked as an advantageous resource to rely on during an emergency. In management the effective use of knowledge may determine if a project is successful or a failure. Melfort was fortunate to have knowledgeable individuals in water management, who were able to navigate the city through the challenges of the water crisis. Knowledge means having the right information, experience, and relationships to get the job done (Al-Alawi et al., 2007).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between these individuals they had acquired decades of information, experience, and fostered relationships in the community both professionally and personally. As residents of Melfort, and locals to the area, there is a strong understanding of the area. The first individual who had a specialized knowledge in potable water treatment was the Manager at the SaskWater facility. The second individual was the Director of Works and Utilities, and was essential to Melfort’s operations. Without these individuals knowledge the response to the oil spill would not have been as efficient or effective. The knowledge of critical infrastructure is another vital piece of information which helped the transition to the alternative water source. An important valve for water was marked, and located in a farmer’s field; however, the farmer had plowed over the post, and made it difficult to locate during the water emergency.  Without the previous knowledge of the director of works and utilities, it could have taken days to find such infrastructure and added additional stress to the community. Since then the post has been GPS located, and remains on file if another incident should happen in the future; therefore, it is important that their critical knowledge can be transferred to other individuals in water management roles, if they are not available. For successful knowledge transfer you need to have the relevant information, catalogued in a format that is useful for other individuals to access and understand it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the effective knowledge transfer, it may leave communities vulnerable to possible gaps in information when dealing with unforeseen circumstance in water management (Al-Alawi et al., 2007). To ensure a successful transfer of knowledge communities need information that is critical to water management, and be able to catalogue this information in a way that it can be shared by other pertinent individuals (Al-Alawi et al., 2007).

### An Alternative Potable Water Supply
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Melfort’s most important features in the City’s success when dealing with the oil spill was their redundancy in water supply. Having a secondary water supply is an advantage when there is a threat to the primary water source. Drilling into groundwater was not an option for Melfort due to the high mineralization content in the ground water, so Melfort has relied on surface water sources. When the Melfort water treatment plant was built, in 1958, the City used water from the PFRA Star City reservoir as its primary potable water source. The Star City reservoir is sourced from Eagle Lake, approximately 35 kilometers south of Melfort (Lang, 2019). Following SaskWater’s purchase of the water treatment plant the primary potable water source changed to the North Saskatchewan River; however, the pipeline connecting the star city reservoir remained intact as part of the water treatment plant infrastructure. Many communities are not as fortunate as Melfort for having an alternative water supply, and may have to rely on drinking water being trucked into the community.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Some communities will not have any choice but to haul water. Probably a huge percentage”
								-MC2

Therefore it is important for the community to know what alternative sources of water they have available to them prior to an incident.

### Infrastructure Advantages
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, Melfort’s previous water supply from the PFRA Star City reservoir remained piped into the SaskWater water treatment plant, and therefore made it the most feasible option as an alternative potable water source. Melfort used the water supply until 1993, during the transition by SaskWater. There are other bodies of water that could have been used by Melfort in theory as an alternative water source, but if it has not been part of the existing infrastructure it would be more difficult.
Another structural advantage was the intake for the CLWSS, which supplies Melfort, is located 17 feet below the North Saskatchewan River’s surface (SaskWater, 2017). It was beneficial for the intake to be closer to river’s bottom when the contaminants which float on the water’s surface. Other communities with a shallower intake would inevitably be more likely to intake more hydrocarbons into their treatment facilities. However, the crude started to sink towards the riverbed as the crude began to dilute with the water; therefore, the entire water column became contaminated. On July 26, 2016 SaskWater closed their intake for the CLWSS at the North Saskatchewan River (SaskWater, 2017).

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is mandatory for all communities on the pipeline to maintain at least 2 day storage of drinking water in case of such emergencies when using SaskWater as a potable water supplier (Water Pipeline Design, 2015). Melfort’s current storage reservoirs have been used by SaskWater as their reservoirs for other communities on the CLWSS. The SaskWater facility will be undergoing further upgrades starting in 2019 (SaskWater, 2019).

### Having plans in place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saskatchewan, it is mandatory legislation for communities to have emergency management plans in place according to Section 9 of *The Emergency Planning Act, 1989*.  This helps communities foster a culture of safety be ensuring there is a safety committee in place, with a coordinator who can enable local emergency measures when necessary,  The Canadian government shows plans for further improvement by creating the Emergency Management Strategy Canada which is aimed to make communities more resilient by 2030 (Public Safety Canada, 2019). Melfort did not declare a state of emergency during the water contamination incident; however, components of their emergency plans were still beneficial to have in place for initial planning. The EMO coordinator established meetings at Melfort City Hall, the primary Emergency Operations Center (EOC) location, which included some individuals from the emergency directory with official roles; therefore, taking proactive measures to catalogue what resources are available such as an emergency directory, EOC location, notification plans, mutual aid resources, and maps may all be beneficial in a water emergency. Having provisions in place saves time and may help mitigate damage to people, property, or the environment; therefore, it is important to have the coordination where people know their roles, and have practiced those roles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Make sure you're diligent. Make sure you exhausted all your resources, make sure you have a plan and practice”
									-MC2

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saskatchewan, it is still uncommon for communities to have source water protection plans that are exclusively focusing on drinking water protection, but consideration to drinking water can be incorporated into communities’ emergency management plans. Melfort’s emergency plans did include some information on alternate potable water resources for the health authority, and while those measures were not enacted at least they were taken into account.

### Strong Communication Networks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the incident Melfort used many forms of media to gain the public’s attention. Near City Hall there was a large electronic billboard that advertised information relating to the PDWA, and the free additional water being transported into the community. Melfort also has a radio station, so the City is able to broadcast short messages to the listeners in the local area regarding the water disruptions. Social media has also changed the way people share information. Besides Melfort’s website, the City had a Facebook page where followers could find information on events, advisories, and other issues of concern. The majority of the people who were using social media at the time preferred Facebook, but Twitter was also used during the contamination event. While Melfort is a city, it is still a smaller community than many of Saskatchewan’s larger cities. Information spreads fast in small communities where there is a strong social network among friends and neighbours.

### Perception in the Community
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important factor to consider in drinking water management is not only if the water quality is safe to drink, but also the public’s perception of health risks associated with their tap water (Dupont et al., 2014). Risks associated with our tap water is related to our confidence in our institutions regulators to make decisions, and manage potential hazards to our health and well-being (Dupont et al., 2014). These sentiments were supported by interviewees, who know that having the public’s trust is one of the most important determinants in successful water management.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As SaskWater is the commercial Crown water utility, it is able to provide wholesale potable water to communities who are capable of distributing water to its residents. SaskWater understands that supplying potable water does not simply mean that there is a sufficient amount of water safe for human consumption, but also that the water looks and smells pleasant to the consumer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Potable does mean appearance, color, taste, odour is all part of being potable not just safe. Safe is the most important, but all those other things enter into it”
								-MS1

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Melfort also took extra measures to ensure their residents felt supported during the water contamination. The potable water which was hauled into the community was situated ahead of town hall, and accessible to any resident in the area who needed extra potable water. The water was transported by well-maintained water trucks, whose appearance would ensure confidence in any consumer of a safe water supply. Extra water remaining in the truck’s tank were emptied at the end of each day, and a fresh tank of water was brought in each of the following days.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You can get the rusty trucks but then you get that negativity that comes with it.  You have to put your best foot forward. First impressions make a difference.”
								-MC2

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would assume that transporting water by poorly maintained and corroded truck would influence the public’s perception of the water. The lack of trust in a safe water supply may begin discord in the community and decreased moral of its residents.

### Relationships with neighbouring communities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melfort was fortunate to be surrounded by communities that supported the City during the oil spill. The town of Tisdale, located 40 kilometers east of Melfort, had individuals offer to bring in additional free water. Interviewees greatly appreciated this gesture made by Tisdale, and similar communities, for helping provide additional resources and support.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Just bring your truck we will make it work and worry about the bill after. I’ll never forget those words. That means a lot.”
									-MC2

### Climatic Influence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate influence on Melfort’s water supply is very important to consider in their success. Interviewees agreed that it was fortunate they were able to restart uptake into the Northern Saskatchewan on September 16, 2016. Following the hot summer months, the amount of organic matter increased causing the water quality in the Star City reservoir to degrade and become more difficult for SaskWater to treat. If the area was going through a period of drought it would have put the alternative water source under additional stress. The less water there is in the reservoir the less reliable the supply would be for the city, and the more difficult it would be for SaskWater to treat.

## Additional Unanticipated Findings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the previous sections which focused on the most significant contributing factors to Melfort’s success, these additional findings emerged from participant’s responses they felt were important to share. While the oil spill contaminated numerous communities’ drinking water supplies, these results are interesting because they are unique to the City of Melfort.

### Initial attitudes towards the Problem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial informal notifications of the spill meant attitudes towards the water contamination varied based on source of information; however, for most individuals involved in the water management they were not overly concerned when they initially heard about the 2016 oil spill. Some interviewees felt that the initial reports downplayed the seriousness of the spill because few details were initially available, but it sounded like it was soon contained and managed. The magnitude of the environmental incident was not understood, so many individuals were aware of it but not preparing for the worst. It wasn’t until a couple days after the pipeline rupture that management was notified of the extent of the contamination, and the impact it would have on Melfort.

### Had the Support
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interviewees from the City of Melfort and the SaskWater water treatment plant felt they had the support they needed throughout the period of contamination. Water management felt they were equipped to deal with the challenges of the Husky oil spill with representatives from Husky, communication from the EPO with the Water Security Agency, SaskWater head office, and support from neighbouring towns and organizations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Husky, in my mind was excellent in my mind with that they knew that there was a catastrophe, if you want to call it that. And they also took the responsibility for it in the right way, in the sense of they didn't quibble about who's going to do what, when. When the truck showed up here with the water of the told us right out front, will incur no expense for that.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“SaskWater supported the city of Melfort, I mean they were in the same boat”

#### Suggestions for Future Academic research
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research on resilience in communities is still new in Saskatchewan.  Future research would benefit from exploring the barriers that communities experience in securing their source water to reduce their vulnerability. By understanding the factors that help build communities adaptive capacities, it can help prepare other towns and cities to become more resilient in the face of uncertainty.
