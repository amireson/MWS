# Introduction

The North Saskatchewan River Basin Council (NSRBC) is a non-profit organization that has formed to support and direct the implementation of the Source Water Protection Plan for our watershed. The organization vision is providing for the social, economic, environmental, and cultural water needs of future generations. They support interested communities tackle various water issues according to watershed objectives (NSRBC, 2019).

Lakes provide us with many environmental benefits, influence our quality of life, and strengthen the local economy (Government of New Brunswick, 2019). Prairie region contains many water bodies that play an essential role in the ecology and hydrology of the region's landscape (van der Kamp et al., 2008). Monitoring of aquatic ecosystems is of vital importance, especially in shallow eutrophic lakes. Eutrophic lake systems are characterized by poor water quality (Paerl & Huisman, 2008). They provide limited value for human use, preventing their use as drinking water reservoirs, irrigation, commercial fishing, and recreation purposes (Br√∂nmark et al., 2010). With the increasing cottage property value, agricultural activities to feed the global population, and climate change, algae bloom becomes an ever-growing issue in prairie lakes (Sereda et al., 2010). Phytoplankton biomass alters very rapidly in response to modifications of nutrient levels, mainly phosphorus, and nitrogen in shallow lakes (Robin et al., 2014, Li et. al, 2010).

Saskatchewan water bodies essential for drinking, fishing, and other recreational activities undergo severe man held changes from domestic, agricultural, and industrial over time (Pearl & Huisman, 2008). Anthropogenic activities such as intense agricultural practices or poor wastewater treatment system are responsible for nutrient transport, hence affecting the nutrient cycle in aquatic systems (Audet et al., 2014). Changes in water levels, along with other factors, present a unique challenge for prairie water bodies (van der Kamp et al., 2008). As a result, Jackfish and Murray lakes pose significant water quality challenges resulting from nutrient transportation.

Waterbodies rich in nutrient are generally characterized by poor ecological quality and low biodiversity (Robin et al., 2014). Excessive nutrients in water body result in the growth of cyanobacteria (Blue-green algae) and produce toxins that are harmful to human and wildlife (Weatherly, 2013). These toxins can pose serious human health issues interfering with daily activities such as drinking, swimming, fishing, and recreations (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017). Although nutrient fuels the growth of algae in Canadian lakes (ECCC, 2017), other parameters like Total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, water level, amount of precipitation, flushing rate, and evaporation correlate with water quality monitoring (Sereda et al., 2010). Different nutrient forms, including total phosphorus, and orthophosphate, nitrogen as ammonium and nitrate, nitrite monitors water quality.

WSA is responsible for managing and protecting water bodies and water supply in Saskatchewan. It has produced water quality and quantity for various water bodies in the province since the 1960s (WSA, 2017). However, limited data exists for eutrophicated shallow water body such as Jackfish and Murray lakes. The only existing continuous data set is decade data, which has been used in some studies such as 1997-2007 water quality report assessing the health of the lake. The challenge of limited availability of data is due to high inherent natural variability and economic constraint (Robin et al., 2014). For rural communities, the challenge is more significant due to the lack of resources and technical know-how by the majority of the population. As a result, additional knowledge, support, and research are needed in implementing water quality monitoring strategies for rural eutrophic lakes.


## Objectives
To fulfill the role of Masters of Water Security candidate working with NSRBC, the objectives for the Jackfish lake water quality assessment strategy includes;

1. Develop nutrient monitoring strategy and methodology for Jackfish Lake

2. Provide educational tools to support the community in making environmental-friendly decisions

3. Provide visual tools to assist the community in narrowing down nutrient sources and its impact to the lake

Include references as appropriate and write down all reference information in the file references.md
