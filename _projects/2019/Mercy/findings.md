# Summary of findings

Significant reduction of reproduction rate observed in the artificial control sediment may indicate the effect of physiochemical properties of sediment on test organism. This was supported by the effect of low reproduction rate observed in the dilution series. Therefore, the hypothesis proposed during sediment sampling was supported by the results obtained. Although it is uncertain to ascertain the toxicity profile of the sampled sediment due to insufficient biological data, results reviewed show a high potential risk of contamination in Saskatchewan landing samples. Clay particles tend to bind easily to chemicals and other contaminants (Brils, 2004; Forstner, 2004). Stunted growth of the test organism was observed in the Saskatchewan landing sample. This indicates an unfavorable environmental condition of the sediment.

Empirical observation of the study site provides a clear picture of the research problem. The developments of upstream facilities such as dams in the Saskatchewan River has prevented the flow of water, sediment, and nutrient from reaching the Delta resulting in the accumulation of sediments in upstream reservoirs. Consequently, while the Delta is impoverished of sediments and nutrients, upstream reservoirs are suffering from sediments and nutrients loading. Therefore, the continuous degradation of the SRD and the potential loss of vital reservoirs in the Saskatchewan River Basin is alarming and require urgent attention. As a result of insufficient data obtained from the study, the study objective was partially achieved. However, the study presents a step forward to future efforts to restore the delta and unveil relevant limitation that may occur during the ongoing project. Thus, the study is "an eye-opener." More so, irrespective of obvious limitation of the bioassay test in providing sufficient biological data to determine the toxicity profile of the environmental samples, the effect of physiochemical properties on freshwater nematodes was observed. A high potential risk of contamination reviewed in Saskatchewan landing samples will prevent the cost of future focus on the site. Thus, an improvement of this study may focus on sediments from Tobin, Codette, Miry bay, and other upstream sediments.
