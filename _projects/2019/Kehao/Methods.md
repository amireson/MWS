# Methods

## 1. Sampling

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The samplings of pond water at each site in each pond were taken biweekly during the ice-free period (Feb to Oct) in 2014 and 2015. The sampling of algae at each site in each pond was taken biweekly from Jul 16th to Sep 17th in 2014 and from Apr 15th to Oct 13th in 2015.



## 2. Measurements
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pond water samples were sent to the Biogiochemical Analytical Service Laboratory (BASL) at the University of Alberta for water quality analysis. The chemicals measured including Total Phosphorus (TP), Total Particulate Phosphorus (TPP), Total Dissolved Phosphorus (TDP) Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP), Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TDN), Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), Ammonia (NH3), Nitrite + Nitrate (NO2- + NO3-), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). Other water quality factors measured including Conductivity, pH, and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). The instruments and methods used are listed in Appendix C.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each pond has a weather station that recording weather data every 10 minutes. The weather data including Air Temperature, Wind Speed, Rainfall and Solar Radiation.



## 3 Algae Identification
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algae samples were sent to and identified by the Environmental Physiology and Toxicology Laboratory (EPTL) at the University of Alberta.
