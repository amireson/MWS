# Introduction



 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stormwater management pond (SWMP) is a man-made engineered structure that built to mainly receive rainfall and surface water runoff temporarily (City of London, 2019). It plays an important role in urban flood control (City of Edmonton, 2015). In urban areas, the stormwater and other surface water runoff move into SWMPs quickly due to the hard surface like roads and roofs (City of Windsor, 2019). Along the way, many chemicals and particles will dissolve in the water. The sources and chemicals including the fertilizer and pesticides from garden (Lewitus et al., 2008; DeLorenzo et al., 2011); salts, heavy metals, small particles, and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) from roads, driveways and sidewalks (Karlsson et al., 2010; Kayhanian et al., 2003; Marsalek, 2003). The capacity of sewers is limited during heavy rainfall events, the SWMPs can retain the extra stormwater before it can be released into the next drainage system to avoid flood (City of Windsor, 2019). SWMPs can also improve the water quality by allowing chemical-attached particles to sink to the bottom of the pond (City of Toronto, 2019). In addition, some SWMPs are built as environmental landscape so that the surroundings can provide habitat for some animals (City of London, 2019).


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algae is also known as phytoplankton, it contains many different classifications and almost all the major taxonomic groups (Wetzel, 2001). It is estimated to have about 30,000 to more than 1 million species in the world (Guiry, 2012). The main group of algae including cyanobacteria, green algae, yellow-green algae, golden-brown algae, brown and red algae, diatoms, euglenoids, dinoflagellates, and cryptomonads (Wetzel, 2001). Normally, algal growth is limited by the supply of phosphorus (Wetzel, 2001). When the nutrients (mostly N and P) in a water body are exceeded, algae will grow rapidly under appropriate conditions and cause Harmful Algae Blooms (HABs). As the most studied group, cyanobacteria species can produce high toxic toxins that can cause human death, such as hepato-, neuro-, and cytotoxins, irritants, and gastrointestinal toxins (Codd et al., 2005). HABs can last days to months, for the HAB species that do not produce toxins, they can cause harm by consuming exceeded amount of oxygen in the water to kill fish and other aquatic lives.



  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algae blooms in natural lakes and oceans are well studied. Many methods are developed to predict algae growth, dominance, and eutrophic levels in lakes. Using N:P, C:N or C:P ratio to predict dominant species under certain conditions is proved to be a valid method (Chiandet and Xenopoulos, 2010; Anderson et al., 2002; Downing et al., 2001; Downing and McCauley, 1992; Smith, 1983; Tilman et al., 1982;). Some species are also proved have correlation with certain chemicals like dissolved oxygen, phosphate, TP, and TN (DeLorenzo and Fulton, 2009 Vincent and Kirkwood, 2014). Macroscopically speaking, human activities and global warming are the main reasons for increasing HABs in the world (Paerl and Scott, 2010; ). However, the studies about shallow water bodies like SWMPs are very rare.



  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nutrients and pollutants in SWMPs are mainly from household water and the stormwater from the road. Whatâ€™s more, the internal loading from sediments at the bottom of the pond is also important. The composition, chemical and physical characteristics of sediments are very different in different SWMPs based on the land use of their corresponding areas. Although it is confirmed that there are significant amounts of nutrients in sediments (Song et al., 2017; Wetzel, 2001), the relative studies are not a lot. Most of the studies focus on heavy metals and other organic pollutants (Karlsson et al., 2010; Camponelli et al., 2010; German and Svensson, 2005; Marsalek and Marsalek, 1997; Watt et al., 1997; Vopicka, 2009).

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are researches studied the different facilities that playing similar roles as SWMPs. Wakelin et al. (2003) assessed the water quality in stormwater retention basins in Winnipeg. DeLorenzo and Fulton (2009), DeLorenzo et al. (2011), Lewitus et al. (2008), Serrano and DeLorenzo (2008) reported the water quality conditions and the harmful algae species found in coastal stormwater ponds in southeastern coast of U.S. Vincent and Kirkwood (2014) compared the water quality conditions of urban stormwater ponds with that of natural lakes in Ontario. There are rare studies focusing on the algae blooms and water quality of SWMPs, especially in cold areas. Scott and Frost (2017) reported a long-term monitoring water quality data of 29 SWMPs collected in Ontario from 2013 to 2015. However, due to the huge workload, the sampling was all conducted by citizen volunteers. The algae species and eutrophic conditions were not mentioned, too. Olding et al. (2000) and Olding (2000) linked algae conditions to water quality, and provided strong evidence about the relationship of algae community and water quality. But the sampling period is only during summer. In this study, the comprehensive data including algae species, chemical species, water quality factors, and weather conditions were collected and analyzed from a long-term monitoring project on the 4 SWMPs in the City of Edmonton.
