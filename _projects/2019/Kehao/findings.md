# Summary of findings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the function and landuse, SWMPs is easy to retain high level of nutrients, chemicals, and other pollutants. Although SWMPs are not designed as environmental landscape for recreation use, many of them are located in residential area. The bad small smell and harmful toxins caused by algae blooms have caused the bad impacts on residents and their communities. This study proved that the traditional methods used to predict algae growth in large water bodies such as lakes and oceans cannot be applied in small and high eutrophic water bodies like SWMPs. More appropriate methods need to be developed. Compared with natural lakes, the impacts of weather conditions like temperature and solar radiation on HABs are less important than P and N in SWMPs. Both N and P are significant in HABs occurrence. And they have strong correlations with TSS. The snowmelt event in early spring time may cause the re-stratifications of SWMPs. The sources of N and P that can cause HABs may be the internal re-loading from sediments caused by these re-stratifications. To prove that, further studies about the nutrients content in sediments are required.
