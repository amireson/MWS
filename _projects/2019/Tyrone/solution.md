# 9. Towards a Solution
The methodology to estimate the water balance for the D-Zone can be used as a guideline to collect additional data within each zone and generate similar water balances for the other zones within the Zehner aquifer. After generating the water balance for each zone, the allocation limits for each zone of the Zehner aquifer can be established. The figure 15 gives a plan view for the recharge and discharge functions of each zone.

The study proposes an alternative methodology in determining the individual components of a water balance.  Although there are other water balance methods available, the proposed method is novel in that it has provided an alternative solution to the declining water trends in the D-zone of the Zehner aquifer. This alternative methodology can be applied to similar aquifers exhibiting complex geological and hydrogeological conditions characteristic of Quaternary aquifers.
