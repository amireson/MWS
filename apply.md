title: Apply to the MWS
---

The MWS program is completed after 12 months of full-time study. In Term 1 and Term 2 students take 10 fixed courses, including courses in field skills, fundamentals of hydrology, modeling, data analysis, water policy and sustainable water resource management. For a full list of courses, please contact the program director Andrew Ireson. As part of the field course, students stay in at the Hannin Creek Education Center in the Boreal Forest, and conduct streamflow surveys, groundwater pumping tests and other hydrological observations. Over the summer, students work on a project with an external project partner. The project is intended to give students an opportunity to investigate applied topics, which may include scientific, technical, or socio-economic aspects of water security. Projects may be based in Saskatchewan, Canada-wide, or around the world, with particular opportunities for projects in Africa and China. We have project partners from provincial/territorial government (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Northwest Territories) and federal government agencies (Environment and Climate Change Canada), water governance NGOs and consultancies. The projects take place over 14 weeks in the summer, and culminate in a capstone event in late August, where all students present their work.
